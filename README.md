# The Simpson's Friend Finder
Full-stack web application using Express to handle routing of client-side requests.

## Overview: 
The Simpson's Friend Finder is a fun quiz that takes in the user's information provided and compares their answers with those from other users (Simpson characters).  The app will then match and display the name and gif of the character with the best 'friend compatibility'.
